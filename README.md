# PCA_For_C
This programm takes a matrix as argument and gives us result of refactoring.
You can acces to different methods...
Here is some listing:

sqr(float a); returns the square value of argument

mean_func(); counting mean values of each factor

centered_func(); initial values minus mean values for each factor

dispersion_func(); function which counts dispersion of initial values (or centered)

covmat_func(); function which counts covarience matrix

eigenvalues(); function which returns eigen values and eigen vectors


So, this is it for now, so much work left to do... 

I should add some functions wich allows to open an excel file

Something very strange
